# AIOrganizeMyDesktop
Too lazy to organize my desktop, make gpt + BLIP-2 do it

# Running it
- You will need to pip install these libraries:
`pip install pillow transformers torch openai`
  
- You'll need to add an .env file in the same directory as the main.py. Put your OpenAI key in there, nothing else.
- Update the `path` variable in main.py.
- Run main.py
